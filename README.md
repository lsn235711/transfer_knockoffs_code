# Transfer learning in genome-wide association studies with knockoffs
This repository contains the code to reproduce the numerical results in Ren, Li, Sesia, and Sabatti (2021).

## Folders
* numerical_experiment_synthetic_data/: contains the code to reproduce the numerical results in Section 3.1 Numerical Experiments -- Synthetic data. To replicate the experiments, one needs to run the "run-me.sh" file on a computing cluster, and then run the "plot_results.R" file to make the plots. The "script.sh" file is specifically designed for the [Stanford Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/) cluster. One may need to modify the files correspondingly.
